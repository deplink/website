Quick Access Manual
===================

Quick Access is a **search engine to easy navigate between pages** on Deplink website. Be careful, it's very addictive feature and you'll miss it on the other sites.

**How it works?** Each page on the site has it own title, description, content and url. Almost all of the this elements are used when you search using Quick Access tool. Only content of the each page was omitted to improve performance and reduce search results.

Quick Access engine is powered by the [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io), thanks to Kiro Risk for this amazing library!

Shortcuts
---------

Results could change over time when new pages comes to the documentation and some titles or descriptions change. Shortcuts was created to provide more convenience on navigating on the site. The predefined shortcuts ensure that you'll go to the same page each time you type it. Try the following ones:

- `github` - project on GitHub,
- `blog` - go to blog on medium,
- `repo` - opens **Official Online Repository**,
- `download` - go to the Download page,
- `help` - link to the page you're currently reading.

If you think there should be created a new shortcut then feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub](https://github.com/deplink/website/issues).
